  <h1 class="post-title">Learning By Failing</h1>
  <span class="post-date">2015.09.07</span>
  <p>I’m just starting my third week of The Firehose Project online bootcamp. Thus far it has been a roller-coaster ride for me.  Days of intensity, days of distraction and days of quiet persistence.  Moments of sheer delight, moments of sheer frustration.  I’ve done as much soul-searching as I have pouring over code.</p>

<p>As with any new learning experience, I am often awed by the enormity of what I don’t know.  Perhaps that should read: I am often <i>overwhelmed</i> by the enormity of what I don’t know.  Many-a-time I have no choice but to helplessly follow along where my lessons lead, trusting that some future chapter will shed light on what is not yet clear to me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Good Code comes from experience, and often experience comes from bad Code.”<sup>1</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point I am learning a great deal from my errors, typos, and mistakes.  Clever parallel to life, that.  After sludging through a particularly nasty experience, a little wiser for the pain, I generally say “Well I’m not going to do THAT again!”.</p>

<p>FHP is clever in their teaching style in that they intentionally write certain errors into the lessons.  The better to teach what NOT to do.  I enjoy spotting the errors ahead of time when I can, trying to determine how to avoid them.</p>

<p>As I read the objectives of each lesson I try to pinpoint what files I’ll have to edit, what methods I’ll have to add.  Given a new process, I try to apply what I learn early in the lesson to other parts of my current App before I am instructed to do so, to see if I grokk it well enough to run with it.</p>

<p>Most days I do everything I can to AVOID asking for help.  <i> Note: this is a blessing and a curse.</i>  I learn more by figuring out for myself why something doesn’t work than I would by being spoon-fed the answer. BUT…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The woods are lovely, dark and deep,. But I have promises to keep,. And miles to go before I sleep,. And miles to go before I sleep.”<sup>2</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is always a new rabbit-hole to dive down here.  Always just one more detail to be hammered out before going back to the lesson.  I have to remind myself that I have a finite period for learning all FHP has to teach me and there is a point at which it will do me more harm than good to keep struggling on my own.</p>

<h3 id="here-be-monsters">Here be Monsters:</h3>

<p>Final thought for tonight… There is a REASON why uncharted waters held fictitious monsters.  The unknown can be a dark and frightening experience as you find your way.</p>

<p>There are always frustrations.  (Monsters to fight.)  Trying to learn and understand it all at once can get you lost, overwhelmed.  Sometimes there is no help but to take a step back and disconnect for a bit.  As much happy fun brain-candy as there is learning to code, an hour or two of a thorough distraction is like a server reboot.  Laugh.  Let it go.  Pick it up tomorrow.  Clear out the buffers, start fresh.</p>

<p>Unconscious cognition happens when you are focused on something else.  You may see clearly after a good night’s sleep and a playful interlude.</p>
