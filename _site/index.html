    <span class="post-date">2016.05.30</span>

    <p>There are days when the spirit may be willing but I just can’t seem to buckle down and dive into the code.</p>

<p>On those days when I can’t find my A-game with two hands and a flashlight I often find it is beneficial to watch coding videos. It’s a passive activity that can still pro-actively add to my personal <b><i>knowledge::base</i></b> and help advance my skills.</p>

<p>Often these will be Railscasts or DevTips videos that actually help me learn skills for specific tasks I’m trying to achieve in an active project or coding challenge.  Occasionally they’ll be inspirational TED videos or Vodcasts by developers ‘in the trenches’ that address shared experiences.</p>

<p>One Youtube channel I adore is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCO1cgjhGzsSYb1rsB4bFe4Q">funFunFUNction</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/mpjme">mpjme</a> is a riot and among other things his episode on the <a href="https://youtu.be/2qYll837a_0">Phases in the life of a Developer</a> helped me to stop being fixated on striving to achieve perfection of elegant code and let me stop worrying that I would be drummed out of the Rails community for writing If/Then statements longhand.  (They’re freakin’ EASY TO READ, PEOPLE!)</p>

<p>I keep a handy list of videos I’d like to watch and topics I’d like to investigate for those days when the raw code isn’t speaking to me.  I try to use my mental downtime to my advantage in the fine tradition of Sesame Street.</p>

<h2 id="a-little-perspective-and-flexibility-go-a-long-way">A little perspective and flexibility go a long way</h2>

<p>While it IS important to keep working on your skills and adding to your knowledge that doesn’t have to mean an intense full-day-of-coding practice EVERY DAY. Coming up for air from time to time will act as a natural flow control valve to limit the input to manageable chunks.  It will give your brain a chance to chew and swallow what you’ve been feeding it.  Try to do it all at once and you may just suffer from information overload.</p>

<p>Spend a few hours hip-deep in code then go read or write a blog post.  Read an article.  Catch up on industry news.  Watch a video.  Take a walk.  Pacing yourself will do wonders for retention.  DON’T try to do it all at once.  You can’t upload this knowledge a la the “I know Kung-Fu” scene from The Matrix (much as we may all WANT to do it that way!)</p>

<p>Working at this 6-10 hours a day, 7 days a week for weeks on end may be a great way to learn but it’s also a great way to blow a fuse.</p>

<p>So on those days when you just can’t bring your A-game, take a step back, find a distraction, watch an industry-specific vodcast or screencast. Better yet take SEVERAL steps, all the way out the front door.  See that scary bright electromagnetic disturbance in the sky?  That’s the sun.  Yeah it’s trying to kill you, but a little bit of exposure to it daily will actually improve your overall health and well-being.</p>

<p>Health and wellness will give you the strength to sit still and stare at a screen for 16 hours a day and WRITE MORE CODE!  Mwa-Hahahahahahahahahahaha!</p>

<p>Um.  Pardon me.  I think I’ll step outside for a few minutes…</p>

    <p>Much as I wish this were an <a href="http://alanwatts.com/">Allen Watts</a>-esque style discourse on the eternal yet ephemeral nature of time, my Post Title is more a sign of contrition… I have let my blog lapse for a month as I transitioned from a student to… well something approaching ‘Intern’ on the learning spectrum.</p>

<p>My last month in <a href="http://www.thefirehoseproject.com/">the Firehose Project</a> was intense and fulfilling and draining all at the same time. I was rushing to finish a few solo projects and starting a group project and trying to cram as much learning and doing into my last precious days as I could.</p>

<p>Did I emerge from the program a Ruby on Rails Expert? Nope. But I DID emerge as a well-indoctrinated Ruby on Rails Novice with some solid skills and a hunger to build upon them. As with any new discipline, I now have a much better idea of the scope of what I do not know. And I add to my knowledge and skills daily.</p>

<p>I am currently working on a group project with a team of FHP students and a skilled Lead (Group Mentor) in the “Product Manager” role (though sometimes that may be closer to a kindergarten teacher role - he wrangles cats and bolsters egos and makes sure we clean up our Legos™… hmm come to think of it that’s probably about right for “Product Manager”)</p>

<p>Hard to describe the highs and lows of this venture. A friend asked me yesterday how I like it. And here is the gist (no github pun intended, but there it is!) of my response(s):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“It is good, frustrating, up-hill progress that has me working 10-12+ hours in a stretch without looking up.” “I love it so long as I don’t spend more than ~24 hours hard-core stuck.” “It stimulates my brain.” “Every little section I finish is a new reason to party.” “I get to see results of my work. It’s like editing sound, there is immediate gratification and satisfaction.” “I get to move Trello cards from Backlog to In Progress to Completed and get little stickers of accomplishment just like flippin’ kindergarten! I LOVE IT!” –me</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This group project is kicking my arse, but in a GOOD way. It challenges me and keeps me on my toes and helps me learn and practice all sorts of useful skills that run the <a href="https://github.com/FallGambit">Gambit</a> from working on a team to version-control to the nuts-and-bolts of writing code. I am utterly leveling up my TDD and Git skills. No question. And the satisfaction of watching our App grow from printed instructions to a functional piece of software is BRILLIANT!</p>

<p>I’m not saying there haven’t been challenging days, but each stumbling block is a learning-experience-in-disguise and each frustration is the potential for satisfaction. Now if only I could remember that whilst in the thick of it!</p>

<div class="message">
  Heh... On that note: I happened to be watching Bill Burr last night (don't hold it against me, I didn't pick it!) and he said something about the process of learning home repairs and maintenance that I feel COMPLETELY applies to the process of learning to code... The pertinent sound-byte is in the first 10 seconds, watch the rest at your own risk. ;-)

<p>I haven’t felt this happy/content/satisfied on a daily basis for a very long time. I am learning and growing my coding skills daily and having a blast. Choosing to Ride the Rails has started me in a truly rich and positive new direction for my life.</p>

<p>Today I feel much like I felt in my <a href="/2015/09/02/epiphany/">First Post</a> “The Adventure Begins…” and I am eager to get to the next stop on the Ruby Express.</p>

    <span class="post-date">2015.11.02</span>

    <p>My coding mentor instructed me last week to “Dive Deep” while working on my current App. Essentially he wanted me to spend time understanding the whys and hows of all the commands, connections, methods, assets, interactions between components of the MVC, calls to the ORM… Anything I touched I was supposed to deepen my understanding of. I even took notes longhand « with a pen « in a paper notebook for some of these.</p>

<p>Yeah. The ones without links are still cooking. Suffice it to say I’ve been drinking from the Firehose this past week. And I have more homework/leads to research more of for the COMING week. No big surprise there, I’ve still got lots to learn and tons to review. I’m pushing myself to progress as far as I can prior to the start of my Group Project, now slated to kick off come Saturday… 5 days from now.</p>

<p>Caught somewhere between nervous and eager at this point. I should write some test classes to help me determine which way is UP once we get going. But would they be Functional or Unit tests? Functional tests on the GravitationalForcesController?</p>

<p>Something to contemplate.</p>

    <p>So I wrote a Stack Class in the process of working on a new coding challenge yesterday. The Stack was explained as an abstract data structure that is Last-In-First-Out.

<p>There is a functional limit to the integers that can be pushed to the stack of 1152921504606846975.</p>

<p>That is “fffffffffffffff” in Hexadecimal.</p>

<p>I could increase the functional limit by changing the base I convert to to push the data onto the stack, but I didn’t need a gianormous limit and I’m used to working with Hex so I kept it simple.</p>

        Check Your Assumptions
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">2015.10.19</span>

    <p>I spent much of the weekend frustrated. The REASON I was frustrated was because I didn’t Check My Assumptions.</p>

<p>I was working on a coding challenge.  My solution involved having two copies of a multi-dimensional Array.  I would inspect the first copy (hereafter FC) and based on the results of the inspection make CHANGES to the second copy (SC). This wasn’t necessarily a difficult proposition.  I had already solved this problem once and was working on a refactor to improve efficiency.</p>

<p>I started with a clone of my original code and I set about making modifications to eliminate a secondary method and fold it in to the initial iteration of the Array.</p>

<p>Every time I ran the refactored code I found that it was not only changing the SC of the Array, but also the FC. <em>Note: Needed deep copy by way of Marshaling, ‘tis another story.<sup>1</sup></em></p>

<p>The thing that was frustrating the begeebers out of me was that each time I reran my original solution IT WORKED!  The FC was unchanged and the SC was properly modified HUZZAH!</p>

<p>…Except that that WASN’T actually the case.</p>

<p>I needed to <span><u>Check My Assumptions</u></span>.</p>

<p>I forgot that I had changed the order of the methods I called when I tested my refactored script. And while the original solution DID properly make changes to the SC, it WAS simultaneously changing the FC. Problem was I didn’t know that because I was only inspecting the FC BEFORE calling the method to apply the changes to the SC.</p>

<p>I hadn’t held my test methodology constant in the refactored script, so I was seeing a different set of results. Once I realized my error I changed the order I was calling the methods in my original solution script and found that IT TOO had changed the FC at the same time it was changing the SC.</p>

<p>Had I just Checked My Assumptions I might have saved myself days of frustration and headaches as I chanted over and over “But it worked in the original solution!”</p>

<h2 id="check-your-assumptions-at-the-door">Check Your Assumptions At The Door!</h2>

<p>The moral to this story is this: Check Your Assumptions. Start with a fresh pair of eyes EACH AND EVERY TIME you look at the code. Reset your expectations. Go back and examine your code, your methodology, your order of invocation. Faulty assumptions are PEBKAC 100% of the time, so CYA.</p>
