    <span class="post-date">2015.10.23</span>

    <p>So I wrote a Stack Class in the process of working on a new coding challenge yesterday. The Stack was explained as an abstract data structure that is Last-In-First-Out. I needed to have a functional stack to complete my assignment and at some point I went off on a tangent to code a Number Stack.</p>

<p>This is somewhat my ode to the IP Stack, in that it encodes data and bit lengths to represent items on the Stack.</p>

<p>There is a functional limit to the integers that can be pushed to the stack of 1152921504606846975.</p>

<p>That is “fffffffffffffff” in Hexadecimal.</p>

<p>I could increase the functional limit by changing the base I convert to to push the data onto the stack, but I didn’t need a gianormous limit and I’m used to working with Hex so I kept it simple.</p>

        Check Your Assumptions
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">2015.10.19</span>

    <p>I spent much of the weekend frustrated. The REASON I was frustrated was because I didn’t Check My Assumptions.</p>

<p>I was working on a coding challenge.  My solution involved having two copies of a multi-dimensional Array.  I would inspect the first copy (hereafter FC) and based on the results of the inspection make CHANGES to the second copy (SC). This wasn’t necessarily a difficult proposition.  I had already solved this problem once and was working on a refactor to improve efficiency.</p>

<p>I started with a clone of my original code and I set about making modifications to eliminate a secondary method and fold it in to the initial iteration of the Array.</p>

<p>Every time I ran the refactored code I found that it was not only changing the SC of the Array, but also the FC. <em>Note: Needed deep copy by way of Marshaling, ‘tis another story.<sup>1</sup></em></p>

<p>The thing that was frustrating the begeebers out of me was that each time I reran my original solution IT WORKED!  The FC was unchanged and the SC was properly modified HUZZAH!</p>

<p>…Except that that WASN’T actually the case.</p>

<p>I needed to <span><u>Check My Assumptions</u></span>.</p>

<p>I forgot that I had changed the order of the methods I called when I tested my refactored script. And while the original solution DID properly make changes to the SC, it WAS simultaneously changing the FC. Problem was I didn’t know that because I was only inspecting the FC BEFORE calling the method to apply the changes to the SC.</p>

<p>I hadn’t held my test methodology constant in the refactored script, so I was seeing a different set of results. Once I realized my error I changed the order I was calling the methods in my original solution script and found that IT TOO had changed the FC at the same time it was changing the SC.</p>

<p>Had I just Checked My Assumptions I might have saved myself days of frustration and headaches as I chanted over and over “But it worked in the original solution!”</p>

<h2 id="check-your-assumptions-at-the-door">Check Your Assumptions At The Door!</h2>

<p>The moral to this story is this: Check Your Assumptions. Start with a fresh pair of eyes EACH AND EVERY TIME you look at the code. Reset your expectations. Go back and examine your code, your methodology, your order of invocation. Faulty assumptions are PEBKAC 100% of the time, so CYA.</p>

        Leveling Up
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">2015.10.12</span>

    <p>Oh the Whirlwind…</p>

<p>Since my last post I think it’s fair to say that I have Leveled Up, both in Ruby and in Rails.</p>

<h2 id="leveling-up-rails-with-tdd">Leveling Up Rails with TDD</h2>

<p>Since my last post I have been working on a new App, the catch is that this one is being built from the ground up with <b>T</b>est <b>D</b>riven <b>D</b>evelopment practice of writing the tests first and then coding the feature.  This makes incremental changes less likely to break any necessary features, it also seems to increase the time it takes to build anything by orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>Granted, the first set of features took the longest to build the tests for first, by the second and third I was starting to get the hang of it.  Still, the essential process is 1) Build tests that fail because the feature isn’t built yet.  2) Build out the feature until the tests pass.  Generally speaking this includes multiple Assertions per test to account for facets of the feature in question, such that as the feature is built in stages, the test for that feature goes from Failing, to Erring on successive Assertions, to passing all Assertions, at which point the feature SHOULD be built as designed.</p>

<p>By the third set of Tests/Build-outs I was really starting to feel comfortable with the process.  I know I have a lot to learn, but going from building apps haphazardly to building with TDD seems like a solid case of Leveling Up.  That was my Rails breakthrough.</p>

<h2 id="leveling-up-ruby-with-coding-challenges">Leveling Up Ruby with Coding Challenges</h2>

<p>I also successfully completed about 3 dozen <a href="http://www.codewars.com/">CodeWars</a> Kata.  I think technically that has me Leveled up twice… I went from 8kyu to 6kyu… I have that much-coveted score of “69” … SO not kidding. Yeah moving on. What a brilliant learning tool! Form of a game, form of a challenge, form of a competition… however you take it, CodeWars can help anyone Level Up their programming skills… I was working in Ruby but they also have Clojure, CoffeeScript, C#, Haskell, Java, JavaScript and Python.  I am considering myself well-informed at this moment because I have at least HEARD of the majority of those languages. Yikes. This is what I get for dropping out of programming for two and a half decades. I have a WEE bit of catching up to do. Thankfully CodeWars can help!</p>

<p>In the meantime I also completed a coding challenge in <a href="http://www.thefirehoseproject.com/">FHP</a> that certainly WAS a challenge.  I beat my head against the wall for hours at a time for two days and then in the wee hours of the morning when I should have been sleeping a new approach occurred to me and sure enough on day three I was able to tackle the challenge from a different direction. The change in perspective allowed me to solve the problem that had me pulling my hair out for two days. This harkens back to my days working at the Center for Creative Learning and some of the techniques I encountered there. Essentially, if you can’t get in the front door, try climbing in a window around the side. But I feel pretty strongly that I Leveled Up my Ruby capabilities along the way.</p>

<p>I am finding that breakthroughs in skill level tend to follow shortly on the heels of feeling frustrated to the breaking point, and/or beating my head against a brick wall. I take my skills as far as they can go and then I have to Level Up in order to progress further, unlocking both capacity and potential in the process. There is a distinctive feeling of that “click”… the intangible sensation that pieces of the puzzle have just moved into place and the picture has become more clear.  It is a good feeling. Gives me just the right surge of energy to start tackling the next level.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic.” – Arthur C. Clarke</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The magic that conjures the form and function of the modern tech-centric world is an excellent example of Arcane Knowledge. 99% of the users consuming ubiquitous technologies of this age have NO CLUE how or why they work, or how to build them. They open smartphones and browsers and are instantly connected and living augmented reality lives without even knowing what “Augmented Reality” means.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stargazing apps that superimpose constellations upon the night sky…</li>
  <li>Virtual museum tourguides enhancing the physical collections with interactive digital multimedia tours…</li>
  <li>Heads Up Displays built in to windshields and glasses…</li>
  <li>Modern capture-the-flag games that allow you to take over virtual power centers if you are in physical proximity to their virtual geophysical location…</li>
</ul>

<p>Examples of magic that are everyday realities RIGHT NOW. Most of the users of these technologies have NO FLIPPIN CLUE how they work. Heck, most consumers of modern technology probably don’t know how radio transmissions can make sound come out of a box.</p>

<p><i>MMXV represents the year 2015 in Roman Numerals.</i></p>

<p>Though technology is central to the essential infrastructure of much of society today, most folks who use it don’t know how to build it, service it, or advance it. Those skills are elite specializations, the exclusive purview of practitioners of modern magics: engineers, developers and sysadmins. Arcane Knowledge.</p>

<p>The brilliance of living in this modern world is that, while the knowledge may be Arcane, access to that knowledge is no longer limited to a subset of sacred initiates inducted into secret societies. Just as the technologies are ubiquitous, they are oftentimes also transparent. The truth is out there!</p>

<p>Anyone willing to dedicate the time and mental resources to learning the alchemy and spellcasting of conjuring modern technological wonders has almost unlimited access to this Arcana. Not only can you learn it, you can then feed back into the system and build upon and advance the collective knowledgebase. Cooperative perpetuation.</p>

<p><i>One Mole is 6.022 x 10<sup>23</sup> elementary particles. Avogadro’s Number.</i></p>

<p>As magicians who conjure modern wonders do so by standing on the shoulders of giants, there are whole communities of peer magicians dedicated to helping anyone who approaches those giants to climb up and stand tall. We collectively curate our magical tome. We are all responsible for learning, practicing, and teaching each other. Thus assuring there will always be new giants, and there will always be another wave climbing upon their shoulders.</p>

</p>

<p>The reality of technology today is that the Arcana is now held in cooperative public trusts by those who love technology rather than antagonistic private vaults. Anyone who WANTS to learn to conjure the form and function of the modern tech-centric world has an open invitation to experience endless wonder. Anyone who thinks they can build it better has the tools and source materials at their disposal. And we all benefit from sharing in and contributing to this public repository of knowledge for love of the game.</p>

    <span class="post-date">2015.09.27</span>

    <h2 id="national-coffee-day-2015">National Coffee Day 2015</h2>

<p>I love coffee.  There can be no doubt in the minds of any person who has ever met me that I have a raging affinity for the sacred ambrosia: dark, hot, rich, decadent COFFEE.</p>

<p>To illustrate, I have precisely ONE item in my Zombie-Apocalypse-preparedness kit… a hand-crank burr grinder.  I have not yet managed to start my own cottage coffee plantation in a greenhouse in my back yard to GROW my own beans to grind IN the grinder, I have not yet solved the problem of how then to ROAST the coffee I will one day grow for myself (I’m sure it can be done in a skillet over an open flame in a pinch) but by all that is holy if I am ever without power I WILL HAVE THE ABILIY TO GRIND MY BEANS.</p>

<p>I acknowledge that this madness, but it is my madness.</p>

<p>In the spirit of National Coffee Day I wanted to post the first Gist I ever posted on Github:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/amarkpark/d6570856b3531c475513.js"></script>

<p>And as I was contemplating this special occasion, over a cup of rich medium roast, it occurred to me that every time I edit the Gemfile for a RoR project I see <a href="https://github.com/rails/coffee-rails">Coffee-Rails</a>.</p>

<p>I have wondered what it was so it seemed like a good time to look into it.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>CoffeeScript adapter for the Rails asset pipeline. Also adds support for .coffee views.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And from <a href="http://coffeescript.org/">coffeescript.org</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><span><b>CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript.</b><span> Underneath that awkward Java-esque patina, JavaScript has always had a gorgeous heart. CoffeeScript is an attempt to expose the good parts of JavaScript in a simple way.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>

<p>CoffeeScript is to JavaScript what Ruby is to C.  Granted, that is a vast oversimplification.  But this is an interesting parallel.  Take something that, while powerful and functional in its own right, is perhaps convoluted and complex and make it elegant and simple.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.” – Isaac Newton</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Progress is made by advancing the collective knowledge. Ruby makes OOP elegant and simple.  CoffeeScript makes JavaScript elegant and simple. These are the tools of the current builders.<sup>1</sup></p>

<p>If I want to light a fire I don’t rub two sticks together, I whip out a Blu-flame Zippo. If I want coffee I grab a pack of beans, grind them, and brew them.  I didn’t grow the beans, I didn’t build the grinder, but they are the tools I use to make something essential every day.</p>

<p>The tools available to those of us who wish to build Apps are elegant and powerful. Thus we may stand upon the shoulders of giants, coffee in hand, and build the future.</p>
