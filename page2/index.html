        Learning By Failing
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">2015.09.07</span>

    <p>I’m just starting my third week of The Firehose Project online bootcamp. Thus far it has been a roller-coaster ride for me.  Days of intensity, days of distraction and days of quiet persistence.  Moments of sheer delight, moments of sheer frustration.  I’ve done as much soul-searching as I have pouring over code.</p>

<p>As with any new learning experience, I am often awed by the enormity of what I don’t know.  Perhaps that should read: I am often <i>overwhelmed</i> by the enormity of what I don’t know.  Many-a-time I have no choice but to helplessly follow along where my lessons lead, trusting that some future chapter will shed light on what is not yet clear to me.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Good Code comes from experience, and often experience comes from bad Code.”<sup>1</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>At this point I am learning a great deal from my errors, typos, and mistakes.  Clever parallel to life, that.  After sludging through a particularly nasty experience, a little wiser for the pain, I generally say “Well I’m not going to do THAT again!”.</p>

<p>FHP is clever in their teaching style in that they intentionally write certain errors into the lessons.  The better to teach what NOT to do.  I enjoy spotting the errors ahead of time when I can, trying to determine how to avoid them.</p>

<p>As I read the objectives of each lesson I try to pinpoint what files I’ll have to edit, what methods I’ll have to add.  Given a new process, I try to apply what I learn early in the lesson to other parts of my current App before I am instructed to do so, to see if I grokk it well enough to run with it.</p>

<p>Most days I do everything I can to AVOID asking for help.  <i> Note: this is a blessing and a curse.</i>  I learn more by figuring out for myself why something doesn’t work than I would by being spoon-fed the answer. BUT…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The woods are lovely, dark and deep,. But I have promises to keep,. And miles to go before I sleep,. And miles to go before I sleep.”<sup>2</sup></p>
</blockquote>

<p>There is always a new rabbit-hole to dive down here.  Always just one more detail to be hammered out before going back to the lesson.  I have to remind myself that I have a finite period for learning all FHP has to teach me and there is a point at which it will do me more harm than good to keep struggling on my own.</p>

<h3 id="here-be-monsters">Here be Monsters:</h3>

<p>Final thought for tonight… There is a REASON why uncharted waters held fictitious monsters.  The unknown can be a dark and frightening experience as you find your way.</p>

<p>There are always frustrations.  (Monsters to fight.)  Trying to learn and understand it all at once can get you lost, overwhelmed.  Sometimes there is no help but to take a step back and disconnect for a bit.  As much happy fun brain-candy as there is learning to code, an hour or two of a thorough distraction is like a server reboot.  Laugh.  Let it go.  Pick it up tomorrow.  Clear out the buffers, start fresh.</p>

<p>Unconscious cognition happens when you are focused on something else.  You may see clearly after a good night’s sleep and a playful interlude.</p>

    <h2 id="v101">v.1.0.1</h2>

<p>My goal for this morning was to do TWO things… change the colors of the titles and navdrawer, and change the format of the post date to YYYY.MM.DD</p>

<p>Sadly v1.0.1 of this blog represented at least 2 hours of work.  2 hours I didn’t have to spend.  AND I need to figure out how to fix the title links that link to the individual post pages.  I think it’s the same problem that I was having with content placement and relative vs. absolute paths.  As though perhaps something isn’t right in the layout hierarchy or the site.baseurl variable.  Meh.</p>

<p>I spent 12 hours coding and styling a Web App in my online Full-Stack bootcamp yesterday. I managed to make pagination function.  Then I looked at how many more chapters were left in the lesson for this particular App.  I had finished Chapter 3.  There are 13 total.</p>

<p>To say I was a tad deflated was an understatement.</p>

<p>We have a student Google+ group where we share and interface.  There are several posts there that describe a learning/enthusiam curve graph.  For certain I have taken the nose-dive into the major slump of the curves.  I am trying to keep my enthusiasm up as I learn how much I have to learn.  Trying to convince myself it may some day be worth it in the end when I may possibly get a job doing Full-Stack development for a living.</p>

<p><i><b> Note the conditional statements above. </b></i></p>

<p>Yep.  I’m having a hard time finding hope with two hands and a flashlight in my teeth right about now.</p>

<p>Time for a snack.  Maybe some <a href="http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/ggmain/strips/ggmain20071015.jpg">Spark Roast</a> and a good <a href="http://www.girlgeniusonline.com/newreaders.php">Comic</a>.  Because once my stomach is appeased I’m going to <a href="http://www.thefirehoseproject.com/">DIVE</a> BACK IN DAMN-IT!</p>

  <strong>#YouKnowYoureAWebDeveloperWhen</strong> A quick static page accidentally becomes a multipage Bootstrapped site w/ header logo and content in ver 1.1
</div>

<h2 id="that-was-my-ah-ha-moment">That was my “Ah Ha!” moment</h2>

<p>I had been revising what should have been a simple static page with a few lines of text on it for <em>HOURS</em>, happily diving down the rabbit hole in order to resolve a few issues I had and adding “just one more thing…” “just one more thing…” until my single simple HTML page had become a sleek multi-page app with a header and a child page and a logo and content all nicely arranged just so in Bootstrap.</p>

<p>By the end of the day I was composing three different methods to describe a dog’s tail wagging in Ruby and I was thinking of boiling water in terms of a Ruby method.</p>

<p>Coding is my heroine.</p>

<p>I feel a lot like Remo Williams right about now:
